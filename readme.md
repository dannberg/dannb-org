# Repo for dannb.org

This is the personal website for Dann Berg, available at https://dannb.org. It is a static website created using Hugo. I created a custom theme I've lovingly dubbed Danntheme.

Theme is covered by [The MIT License](https://github.com/dannberg/dannb-org/blob/master/themes/danntheme/LICENSE). Have fun!

# Quick reference

## Running the server

`hugo server -D --disableFastRender`

`-D` tells it to render drafts and `--disableFastRender` tells Hugo to rebuild the entire website when there are changes (it's still super fast).

## Creating a new post

`hugo new blog/2023/post-name.md`

# Reference

## Callouts
Callouts based on [hugo-callout](https://github.com/mr-islam/hugo-callout) by mr-islam. To enter a callout:

```
{{< callout emoji="ðŸ”¥" text="This is the text. Must be one paragraph." >}}
```

Callout styling is located in `layouts/shortcodes/callout.html`.
