Hello, I'm Dann. I work at the intersection of engineering, finance, and cloud cost optimization. In simpler terms, I help make big, scary cloud bills not so big or scary.

I lead FinOps at **[Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com)**. Want to do a deeper dive? There's more on my **[About](/about)** page, or you can check me out on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dannberg/)**, **[Github](https://github.com/dannberg)**, and **[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/dann.fun)**. My interests are all over the place, but my **[articles](https://dannb.org/blog/)** and **[newsletter](https://thedannchronicles.com)** are the best way to get a taste of what's catching my attention at the moment. It's also pretty easy to find more about me with a quick **[Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=dann+berg)**. Spelling Dann with two Ns is great for SEO.

In a past life (before the deep dive into FinOps), I was a tech journalist, and my writing has appeared on MSNBC, Fox News, The Verge, Mashable, Laptop Magazine, and Tomâ€™s Guide. I also co-authored two full-length plays with my wife, including "**[The Floorshow](http://combustioncollective.org/the-floorshow/)**," which is about a group of tap-dancing showgirls in the 1950s.

I live in Brooklyn, New York with **[my wife](https://asuleen.com)** and our cat.
