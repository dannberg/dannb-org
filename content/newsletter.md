**Dann shows you things** is a _free_ monthly roundup of interesting miscellanea that caught my attention over the past month. Things I think you'll find interesting as well.
{{% /class %}}

The **Dann shows you things** newsletter isn't just a copy-paste from this blog. It's brand new content not found anywhere else.

It's way more than just a bare-bones link dump — each month you'll find short explorations into _5+ topics_, with relevant links for you to follow when something catches your eye. Some times you may only give each topic a quick glance. Other months, there will be several rabbit holes you'll get sucked into exploring.

I know that sounds vague, so feel free to **[read a sample](https://dannberg.substack.com/)** or two before you subscribe.

**Join 450+ people and sign up to get next month's newsletter!**
